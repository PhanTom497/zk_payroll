# 🔐 ZK Payroll

**Privacy-Preserving DAO Payments on Aleo**

> **ZK Payroll solves the "Compliance-Privacy Paradox" by enabling DAO administrators to prove budget solvency to auditors without ever revealing individual contributor data.**
> **Built on Aleo for total privacy and public verifiability.**

## 🎯 Problem

Public blockchains expose all transaction data. For DAO payroll:
- 💸 Competitors see your compensation structure
- 👀 Salaries become publicly searchable  
- 📊 Payment timing reveals cash flow

## 💡 Solution

ZK Payroll uses Aleo's zero-knowledge proofs to enable **private salaries with public budget enforcement**, ensuring both contributor privacy and organizational transparency.

## 👁️ Privacy Meter: Who Sees What?

| Data | 🌐 Public Observer | 📋 Auditor | 🔐 Admin |
|------|:------------------:|:----------:|:--------:|
| Budget Ceiling | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible | ✅ Visible* |
| Total Spent | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Verified | ✅ Visible* |
| Individual Salaries | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Visible* |
| Recipient Addresses | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Visible* |
| Payment Timing | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden | ✅ Visible* |
| Budget Compliance | ✅ ZK-Proven | ✅ ZK-Proven | ✅ ZK-Proven |

> * *Admin visibility is limited to local history; once a SalaryRecord is issued, only the recipient can decrypt and spend it.*

> **Key Insight**: Auditors verify totals without seeing individual salaries. Public observers only see the budget limit and ZK proof validity.

*The Auditor Portal shows how compliance officers receive verified spending totals via selective disclosure—without seeing individual employee salaries.*

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/PhanTom497/zk_payroll.git
cd zk_payroll

# Build
leo build

# Run demo
leo run initialize_payroll 1000u64 1field <AUDITOR_ADDRESS>
```

### One-Command Verify

```bash
# Run the full test suite
chmod +x test.sh && ./test.sh
```

## 🛡️ Security Model

| Attack Vector | Mitigation |
|---------------|------------|
| Fake budget input | Read from on-chain mapping |
| Stolen AdminCap | `self.caller == owner` check |
| Address leakage | RecipientTicket pattern |
| Cross-payroll replay | Payroll ID consistency |

---

## ⚖️ Compliance & Audit Trail

ZK Payroll enables **regulatory compliance without sacrificing contributor privacy**:

### Selective Disclosure
- Admin generates `AuditReport` for authorized auditors
- Auditors verify `total_spent ≤ budget` without individual salaries
- Report includes immutable `timestamp` for audit trail

### Immutable Timestamp
```
AuditReport {
  owner: auditor_address,
  total_spent: 750u64,        // Verified total
  payroll_id: 1field,
  timestamp: 1738181000u32    // Immutable audit trail
}
```



## 📊 Contract Stats
